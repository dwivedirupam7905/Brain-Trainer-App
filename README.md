# Brain-Trainer-App
Built a basic rapid fire quiz (gaming) application which displays random maths sum problems (with 4 options) to the user at each click and counts the score within a limited time frame of 30 seconds. User can answer as many questions as possible within 30 seconds. It also contains a ‘Play Again’ button and keeps track of the ‘High Score’ as well.
Used **Math.random module** to display random numbers for various questions and answers in the quiz.
